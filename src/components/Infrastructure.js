            In order to effectively architect and develop any solution, one must understand all the moving
            parts in play and have a toolbox of options, methods, and tools ready to meet any challange.
            Here I will go over the technology and tools I am familiar with as well as any notable professional experience.

          I hold the opinion that it is not just enough to be able to develop with a framework or
          against a service. One needs to be able to deploy and configure before they truly appreciate all
          the nuances, edge cases, as well as limitations. Here is a short summary of the services, tools, and frameworks I am comfortable
          deploying and configuring.
